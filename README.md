# jgwilsondesign-site-v2

This site was constructed back in 2013. I'm saving it here for posterity. Unfortunately, I seem to have lost most of the development files and all I have are the production files.

I wrote the CSS using SASS and a framework called [Sassparilla](https://github.com/fffunction/sassaparilla). I wrote some simple interaction stuff in jQuery. And the rest is simple HTML.

As an aside, this was my first project/attempt at a responsive website. If you want to learn something, you just have to do it. :)
